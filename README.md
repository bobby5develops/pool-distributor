Native Javascript and Handlebars client-application. Custom CSS/SASS grid system. Wired-up with Gulp. 
NOTE: Would be cool to have this as a es6/npm-module, to add to native javascript library.

Steps to launch in browser: 
1. clone this repo
2. once downloaded, < npm install -g and npm install --save-dev > for global and local packages
3. run < gulp > in terminal
